Working for drug peace,not drug war!!\n\nComing from a state where a family man, Will Foster, was initially sentenced to prison for 93 years and fined $65,000 after growing marijuana to treat his arthritic pain, the Drug Policy Forum of Oklahoma (DPFOK)  is a group of concerned citizens seeking to open up for discussion alternatives to current drug policy. We believe that the attempt to use the criminal justice system to discourage drug abuse or the so called “war on drugs” has backfired. It simply does not work, and the unintended consequences are now causing more damage to society than the drugs themselves could ever have caused. For too long this critical issue has been obscured by myth, misinformation and an absence of intelligent debate. Our intent is that the information made available will increase the level and quality of the debate so that citizens may be in better positions to affect change toward a sane drug policy.\n\nChanges in drug policy that the DPFOK believes to be desirable can be found at the DPFOK Mission page.

Lucky for me, I’m still 29 for a few more months so I will quickly learn to master miracles or settle into acceptance. Don’t get me wrong, I have an amazing life! So amazing that I feel that I would be neglecting my worldly duties if I didn’t share. So, in a nutshell, I grind out my Monday-Friday 8-5 job that successfully pays the bills but falls short in the self-fulfillment category. I have a part-time gig that I love, unfortunately, it is just part-time.\n\nI admit that my skills are lacking in the focus department, however there are a few things I am passionate about that I do just for me. I play pool (billiards) competitively, I hit the golf course as regularly as possible and I am not above jumping in a recreational volleyball game! I attempt to be crafty, my mother is by far my source of motivation so I’ve tried my hand at a few minor projects all of which I will eagerly be sharing.\n\nMy family is my foundation, support, guidance, reality check, motivation. Let’s just say if I were on “Who wants to be a millionaire” they would consume all 3 of my lifelines.\n\nAt last, my prize possession. The part of me that entertains, inspires, educates and occasionally outright humiliates me, Chandler. (aka mini-me). I have a ton of other silly names that I call him by from time to time and he usually humors me by answering to them. He is 6, going on 30 so we really see eye to eye on a lot of things. Being the only child and the fact that he just started kindergarten gives him all the more reason to feel more grown-up than he really is.\n\nMy days are limitless and very little rarely surprises me anymore. Since most of my friends and family rely on Chandler and I for their daily dose of entertainment, I thought why not just go ahead and share with the world!", "tags": ["3day","billiards","breastcancer","catoosaok","children","cosmo","dog","family","kids","life","magazinereview","pool","tulsaok"]}, {"id": 1880, "joined": "2012-03-12T09:47:46", "title": "jack of all t(i)rades", "url": "http://unpopops.wordpress.com/", "description": "20-something East Coast transplant, learning all I can about Oklahoma and it's amazing people.
